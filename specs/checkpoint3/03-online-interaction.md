Example for rendering other players

 (2 point) Currently Online can only render the other players' position. Try and figure out a way to render change in direction and whether or not a player is moving or not.
(HINT 1: Try to figure out how to change animation direction first for your player. Then figure out how to render animation for online players; maybe you can check how online manager handles it?)

(HINT 2: We've added 'HINT:...' comments, check 'em out!)

 (1 point) Chat Mechanism. Implement a chat system for the online version. (HINT: We've added a chat_overlay.py and some additional comments in game_scene.py)
Guide to Run Online:


Open a terminal and run python server.py
Open two other terminals and run python main.py on each.
Enjoy.
